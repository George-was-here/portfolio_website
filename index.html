                <li><a href=https://github.com/George-was-here/Wiki-Map><h4>WikiMaps</h4></a> &#60;stack&#62;EJS (HTML, AJAX, jQuery), SCSS, Node.js, Express&#60;/stack&#62; <p>WikiMaps is a server-rendered application built using Express and EJS. It was created as a collaborative project,
                  alongside other Lighthouse developers, to understand CRUD applications.</p> <p>It allows users to create maps that are featured in the main home page. These maps can also be shared by a deeplink.
                  After being authenticated, each user is able to create, edit and delete maps with custom pins, title and
                  description.</p></li>

                <li><a href=https://github.com/George-was-here/tweeter><h4>Tweeter</h4></a> &#60;stack&#62;HTML, jQuery, AJAX, CSS, Node.js, express&#60;/stack&#62;<p>Tweeter is a single-page app made to mimic Twitter's functionality. A simple email/password based user
                  authentication was implemented to handle the user's post. Once logged in, the user can create, share, and delete
                  posts.</p><p>Users were allowed to interact with other posts in the platform, in the form of liking, flagging and re-posting other
                  user's posts.</p></li>
                <br />
                <li><a href=https://github.com/George-was-here/Everyones-A-Critic><h4>Everyone's A Critic</h4></a> &#60;stack&#62;React, SCSS, Node.js&#60;/stack&#62; <p>Everyone's A Critic was our final collaborative project at Lighthouse Labs. We took on making a movie library search engine where you could create a profile to curate custom movie playlists, write reviews, and view content from other users.</p></li>
                <br />
                <li><a href=https://github.com/George-was-here/scheduler><h4>Scheduler</h4></a> &#60;stack&#62; React, SCSS, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL &#60;/stack&#62;<p>As the name might suggest, this app was used to schedule appointments between two people, a mentor and a
                student. Using a calendar like UI, users were able to schedule a time slot in someone else 's calendar.</p><p>The Scheduler app was made out of three modules: a client side application, an admin side application and the
                server. The two front-end apps were implemented using React while the server was built using Node.js.</p></li>
