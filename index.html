    <h3>Hello World! My name is George Burt, a Full-Stack Developer from Toronto, Ontario. I recently left a established careeer in hosipitality management to pursue a new career in software development. In my desire to change careeers, I was inspired to find something that I could research meticulously and become engrossed in as when I first started out in hospitality and worked my way up through some of the best restaurtaunts that Canada had to offer. In programming I have found that and more, creating real world solutions to everyday issues. I was a keen writer of fiction through my academic career and coding feels like a great and fitting re-imagining of that; bringing a tradition deeply routed in antiquity to a modern era.</h3>
        <h3>When I am not coding or reading about programming and learning about different computer science concepts I can often be found hiking with my Dogue de Bordeaux Zoe, exploring Georgian Bay, making pilgramages to contemporary art galleries, motorcycling around the escarpment. Over the course of the recent pandemic and multiple lockdowns I found myself out of work in hospitality due to multiple closures. Never once at a loss for things to do, I filled some of this time refinishing and reburbishing Mid-century Modern Furniture, and collecting out 4X4 trucks and working on them. Learning basic mechanics has been a really great experience, you'll usually find me in some old truck or another at my local coffee shop. Please feel free to look over my C.V. here!</h3>

                  alongside other Lighthouse developers, to understand CRUD applications.</p> <p>It allows users to create maps that are featured in the main home page. These maps can also be shared by a deeplink.
                  After being authenticated, each user is able to create, edit and delete maps with custom pins, title and
                  description.</p></li>

                <li><a href=https://github.com/George-was-here/tweeter><h4>Tweeter</h4></a> &#60;stack&#62;HTML, jQuery, AJAX, CSS, Node.js, Express.js&#60;/stack&#62;<p>Tweeter is a single-page app made to mimic Twitter's functionality. A simple email/password based user
                  authentication was implemented to handle the user's post. Once logged in, the user can create, share, and delete
                  posts.</p><p>Users were allowed to interact with other posts in the platform, in the form of liking, flagging and re-posting other
                  user's posts.</p></li>

We took on making a movie library search engine where you could create a profile to curate custom movie playlists, write reviews, and view content from other users.</p></li>

                student. Using a calendar like UI, users were able to schedule a time slot in someone else 's calendar.</p><p>The Scheduler app was made out of three modules: a client side application, an admin side application and the
                server. The two front-end apps were implemented using React while the server was built using Node.js.</p></li>
