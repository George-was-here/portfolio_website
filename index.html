                  alongside other Lighthouse developers, to understand CRUD applications.</p> <p>It allows users to create maps that are featured in the main home page. These maps can also be shared by a deeplink.
                  After being authenticated, each user is able to create, edit and delete maps with custom pins, title and
                  description.</p></li>

                  authentication was implemented to handle the user's post. Once logged in, the user can create, share, and delete
                  posts.</p><p>Users were allowed to interact with other posts in the platform, in the form of liking, flagging and re-posting other
                  user's posts.</p></li>

                student. Using a calendar like UI, users were able to schedule a time slot in someone else 's calendar.</p><p>The Scheduler app was made out of three modules: a client side application, an admin side application and the
                server. The two front-end apps were implemented using React while the server was built using Node.js.</p></li>
